/*
Recursion is a process (a function in our case) that calls itself.

It's everywhere
JSON.parse
JSON.stringify
document.getElementById and DOM traversal algorithms
Object traversal
Cleaner alternative to loops/iteration



How it works
Two main components:

DIFFERENT INPUT: Invoke the same function with a different input until a base case is reached

BASE CASE : The condition under which the recursion ends.
