/*
Big O Notation is a way to formalize counting
It allows us to talk about how the runtime of an algorithm grows as the input size grows

count be linear f(n) = n
count be quadratic f(n) = n^2
count be logarithmic f(n) = log(n)
count be constant f(n) = 1
count be exponential f(n) = 2^n
count be factorial f(n) = n!
count be cubic f(n) = n^3
count be polynomial f(n) = n^k
