/*
Space required by the algorithm to run to completion
Sometimes it's called auxiliary space complexity
Most primitives are constant space O(1)
Strings require O(n) space (n = length of string)
Arrays require O(n) space (n = length of array)
Objects require O(n) space (n = number of keys in object)
