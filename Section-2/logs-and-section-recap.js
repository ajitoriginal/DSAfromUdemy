/*
a logarithm is the inverse of exponentiation.
It answers the question: to what exponent must a base be raised, to produce a given number?
For example, the logarithm base 2 of 8 is 3, because 2^3 = 8.
In mathematical notation, this is written as log2(8) = 3.

We use Big O Notation for:
analyzing the performance of algorithms.
to get high level understanding of the algorithm's efficiency.
it depends on the algorithm not the hardware we used.
