Constants do not matter in Big O notation.
Smaller terms do not matter in Big O notation.
Arithmetic operations are constant time.
Variable assignments are constant time.
Accessing elements in an array (by index) is constant time.
Accessing elements in an object (by key) is constant time.
In a loop, the time complexity is O(n) if the loop runs n times.
